## Modes

- **NORMAL:** Performs basic scan of targets and open ports using both active and passive checks for optimal performance.

- **STEALTH:** Quickly enumerate single targets using mostly non-intrusive scans to avoid WAF/IPS blocking.
- **FLYOVER:** Fast multi-threaded high level scans of multiple targets (useful for collecting high level data on many hosts quickly).
- **AIRSTRIKE:** Quickly enumerates open ports/services on multiple hosts and performs basic fingerprinting. To use, specify the full location of the file which contains all hosts, IPs that need to be scanned and run ./sn1per /full/path/to/targets.txt airstrike to begin scanning.
- **NUKE:** Launch full audit of multiple hosts specified in text file of choice. Usage example: ./sniper /pentest/loot/targets.txt nuke.
- **DISCOVER:** Parses all hosts on a subnet/CIDR (ie. 192.168.0.0/16) and initiates a sniper scan against each host. Useful for internal network scans.
- **PORT:** Scans a specific port for vulnerabilities. Reporting is not currently available in this mode.
- **FULLPORTONLY:** Performs a full detailed port scan and saves results to XML.
- **MASSPORTSCAN:** Runs a "fullportonly" scan on mutiple targets specified via the "-f" switch.
- **WEB:** Adds full automatic web application scans to the results (port 80/tcp & 443/tcp only). Ideal for web applications but may increase scan time significantly.
- **MASSWEB:** Runs "web" mode scans on multiple targets specified via the "-f" switch.
- **WEBPORTHTTP:** Launches a full HTTP web application scan against a specific host and port.
- **WEBPORTHTTPS:** Launches a full HTTPS web application scan against a specific host and port.
- **WEBSCAN:** Launches a full HTTP & HTTPS web application scan against via Burpsuite and Arachni.
- **MASSWEBSCAN:** Runs "webscan" mode scans of multiple targets specified via the "-f" switch.
- **VULNSCAN:** Launches a OpenVAS vulnerability scan.
- **MASSVULNSCAN:** Launches a "vulnscan" mode scans on multiple targets specified via the "-f" switch.
